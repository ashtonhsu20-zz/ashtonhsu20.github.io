                <h4>2014</h4>
                <p>Kulture is an application designed for a human computer interaction course. Traveling to a new environment that has a different language and cultural norms takes time to adjust to. Kulture's primary goal was to help immigrants adapt quicker into a foreign environment by connecting them to organizations and events based on the user's their interests. This above link is designed to demonstrate well thought out user experience as well as a solution to helping immigrants adapt quicker into their environment. We had several iterations and took into consideration user feedback and issues. Note the link is only a mockup and does not have a functioning backend</p>
